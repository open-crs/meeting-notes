## Discussions

Most reviews are now done.

The `vulnerability_analytics` module is designed to run inside a Docker container, but that may not be required.
In order to be on par with the other modules, I would remove the requirement on a Docker container.
We'll see how that goes.

We will create a virtual environment per-module.
Not one globally.
Because there may be clashing requirements from different modules.
