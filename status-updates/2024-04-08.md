## Discussion

- SB: I've bumped into some issues with Ansible for Vagrant.
  Vagrant will work for macOS and Linux.
  For Windows it needs to port update that Laurențiu knows how to do.

- AP: I didn't make much progress since last time.
  We're still stuck with the Docker port / connection issue.

- LU: I'm working with Playwright to create a list of all web endpoints, as part of the attack surface approximation part.
- RD: Use [DVWA](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA) as a target.
- LU: I will then move to using [RESTler](https://github.com/microsoft/restler-fuzzer) for the vulnerability detction part.

## TODOs and Decisions

- RD: Review PR from Sorin: https://github.com/open-crs/attack_surface_approximation/pull/7
