## Discussion

LU: The OpenAPI is done.
It does some sort of crawler, that creates an sitemap.
I need to also fill the forms in web pages, this will be included in the specification.

AP: I investigated the error with Radare2.
I tried to use strace to investigate.

RD: Schedule a meeting with AP.

SB: I checked the documentation from Iosif.
We can create via a GitHub action a VirtualBox image.

SB: I wasn't yet able to use Packer locally.

SB: With the GitHub scripts you are able to create the `VMX` or `VBOX` files in GitHub.

RD: What about the virtual machine disks?

SB: Packer can also create Amazon and Azure images.
